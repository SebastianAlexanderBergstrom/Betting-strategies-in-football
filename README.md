# Betting-strategies-in-football
Note: The files are currently not ordered in folders since I'm in a bit of a hurry, I'll take care of this soon. 11th Septemeber 2018.

The code and data files are part of a hobby project for simulating different betting strategies in football. The general idea behind the functions is described on my blog (see link below).

The documentation of functions is not yet complete but will be uploaded soon enough. This was the first time I wrote code which was not tailored after a specific data set, i.e. it is my first program. All the bugs and shortcomings in design and implementation are my own and all constructive criticism is welcome. 

The analysis of the data sets is available on my blog https://sebastianbergstromsblog.wordpress.com.
